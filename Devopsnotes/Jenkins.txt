                                      *continuous integration*


IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:-
  1) Improve quality:- 
          Improves the quality by running multiply unit test and analysing various static codes.

  2) Increases productivity:-
          Automating build of code saves a lot of time, there by increasing productivity.

  3) Reduces risk:-
          Eliminating the risk of potential human errors by automating test.



INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS:-

   -> Easy installation process 
   -> provides advance security 
   -> optimized performance
   -> upgrades are easy available
   -> light weight container support
   -> distributed team management


WHAT IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:-
     It is the process of automating the building and testing of code, each time one of the team member commit changes to version control.
continuous integration, continuous delivery (or) deployment but delivery is also known as release, then first stage is CI, second stage is CD, 
and third stage is placing the artifact in the web server.

POPULAR CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION TOOLS:-

    -> Gitlab CI
    -> Code ship
    -> Bamboo
    -> Jenkins
    -> Team city
    -> Travis CI

   From the AWS cloud if we want to perform CICD, there are various services like code commit, code deploy and code guru, AWS code build, AWS pipeline.


IN AZURE CLOUD :-
    Azure devops, Azure boards, Azure repos, Azure pipeline, Azure test plans, Azure Artifact.


WHAT IS JENKINS?
       A continuous integration server which manages and control processes such as plain, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor in devops environment.


WHY JENKINS IS SO POPULAR?
   -> Open source
   -> Good plugins support
   -> Good community support 
   -> Fast and reliable
   -> Good OS(operation system) support
   -> scripted builds


TOPICS:-

  -> Jenkins Architecture
  -> Plugin management in Jenkins
  -> Jenkins security management
  -> notification in Jenkins
  -> Jenkins master slave architecture

PLUGIN MANAGEMENT IN JENKINS :~
 
 
              UPDATE -->shows update to already installed
 
              AVAILABLE -->show plugins that are available for installation
=>TABS
              INSTALLED -->display plugins installed that have no updates
 
              ADVANCED -->lists configuration of http proxy allows manual upload of plugin and url plugin site
 
 
In real time we cant install the plugins as simple as simple as that reasons being they meights be challanges
  with proxy settings as well as vpn (virtual private networking) in order to avoide we should configure HHTP 
  proxy in jenkins plugin of advance tab.

         Jenkins is restarting banner:

       This will be displayed on most Jenkins pages. You can use it to let users know what is happening. A default message will be added if you don't supply one.


Plugin installation:

  There are 2 ways to install the plugins

  1) Automatically

  2) Manually. 

    1) Automatically:
         Once we login to Jenkins GUI left 
         Side you will be seen the option of manage Jenkins

           → Click on manage Jenkins →  we have system Configuration, 

           → Click on plugins go to available plugin

           → search for the plugin which is required,

           → select the plugin under the list once you select the plugin install button will be highlighted then click on install button.


      2) Manually:

          Under plugins tab go to available plugin and search for ansible plugin and click on the plugin which is required once you click on the plugin, 
          new tab will be open the click on the releases, under release we will see the various version of the plugin go for the plugin which is required the 
          specific version under the installation option we can see the direct link option we have to click on the direct link plugin will get downloaded to our
          local machine

        → when we download plugin in manually way again we need to deploy to Jenkins.

        → In Jenkins GUI plugins tab click on advanced settings there you can search for the choose file button to upload which is downloaded to local system 
           (or) local machine.

Plugins definition:-

           Where we can add, remove, disable or Enable plugins that can Extend the functionality of Jenkins.

           → When we install the plugin in automatic way plugins Extention is JPI (Jenkins plugin) when Extention.

           we install the plugin in manually way plugin Extention is HPI (hudson plugin)

How to uninstall the plugins:-

          Manage Jenkins → plugins → Install plugins

          → Search Plugin name which we wanted to uninstall select the plugin and then uninstall button will be high lighted once clicked on uninstall,
              plugin will get uninstall.

How to update the plugins

           Manage Jenkins → plugins → updates

           → Select the plugin and then update button will be highlighted once clicked on update, plugin will get update.

Here's how to get this into a Word document:
          * Copy the text above.

          * Open a new Microsoft Word document.

          * Paste the copied text into the document. (You can use Ctrl+V or right-click and select "Paste")

          * Format the text as needed within Word. You can adjust font, spacing, add bullet points, etc.

          * Save the document. Choose a location and file name, and save it as a .doc or .docx file.

   → Select the plugin and then update button will be highlighted once clicked on update, plugin will get update.
 
   → In Real time we should not update the plugins directly, Reason being there may be the challenges Encountered. 
      It will be recommended to plugins in our local machines where other team members will not effected. If any thing goes wrong.

How to create the users?

     Manage Jenkins → Security → Users (Create/Delete/modify users that can log in to this Jenkins.)

   → Click on the users we can see the create user option after clicking on the user option we can see the username, password, confirm password,
       full name, Email address then click on create user.

How to give permission to users:-

    Manage Jenkins → Security (Secure Jenkins; define who is allowed access/use the system)

    → Best click on that there we can see Authorization under that you will see add user button, after click on that button we will get user id after giving
      user id then click on "Ok" button, after that we have to see user is added then we have to give required permission to the user by checking the box 
       (The minimum access is to give over all read)

    → By Default what ever we create users for Jenkins will get stored in Jenkins' own users data base.

    → This is suitable for smaller setup where you have no Existing user data base elsewhere. Other option is LDAP (Lightweight directory Access protocol)

Authorization Strategy:-

       By default we will see project based authorization matrix with these we can manage the authorization based on the options available under strategy.

             Example: Credentials, Agent, Job, Run, Etc...
Matrix authorization strategy:-

          Matrix Authorization allows configuring the lowest level Permissions, such as starting new builds, configuring items, or deleting them individually.

JENKINS PROJECT (PROJECT (OR) JOB BOTH ARE SAME)
 
  IT IS A COMBINATION OF ONE OR MORE TASKS
 
==>FREE STYLE PROJECT:~
 
    classic ,general-purpose job type that checkes out from one scm,executes build steps serially followed by post -build steps like archiving 
    artifacts and sening email notifications.
 
==>MAVEN PROJECT:~
 
    Build a maven project, jenkins takes advantages of your pom file and drastically reduces the configuration
 
==>PIPELINE:~
 
    Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. Suitable for building
    pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily
    fit in free-style job type.
 
==>MULTI-CONFIGURATION PROJECT:~
 
    Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on
    multiple environments, platform-specific builds, etc.
 
==>FOLDER:~
 
    Creates a container that stores nested items in it. Useful for grouping things together. Unlike
    view, which is just a filter, a folder creates a separate namespace, so you can have multiple things
 
 
==>MULTI BRANCH PIPELINE:~
 
    Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.
 
 
==>ORGANIZATION FOLDER:~
 
    Creates a set of multibranch project subfolders by scanning for repositories.
 
 
        HOW TO CREATE THE JOB OR PROJECT :~
 
  In jenkins GUI will see the "+ new items" click on that new item the item name then select the item type once select any of the item
  click on "ok" button which is highlighted
==>> job configuration is conists of general (where we cangive information or discription about the project)
 
==>> source code management where we will be passing url of the repositories
 
==>> build triggers (in what way we wanted to trigger or build the job)
 
==>> build environment
 
==>> build steps (where we can add tasks)
 
==>> post-build actions
 
 
      HOW TO GET A FREE STYLE LEARNING JOB:~
 
==>> NEW ITEM (GIVE THE JOB NAME)
 
==>> select an item then click on "ok"
 
==>> go to the build steps configuration of jbos click on build steps dropdown and select execute windows batch command
 
==>> and just type "dir" and click on save
 
==>> and click on build now option in the leftside and we can check there console output
 
 
                        BLUE OCEAN:~
 
   WHAT IS BLUE OCEAN ?
 
      * blue ocean rethinks the jenkins user experiences designed from the ground up for jenkins pipeline and comatible with freestyle jobs has context menu 


  WHAT IF JENKINS USER FORGOTTED THE PASSWORD?

            As a Jenkins administrator there is a provision to reset the user credentials
  
                             ->  Manage Jenkins -> security -> users -> user id which need to reset

                             ->  Click on security in the lift side we can see
   
                             -> there we can see password and confirm password
 
                             -> there we can change password and click on save

                             -> once as a administrator change the password again you need to inform to the user please follow below steps to change the password.
       
                              -> once logged to the user Jenkins click on user name we can see in top right corner click on security there we can change the password.

what if jenkins administrator forget the password?

                        -> As a Jenkins administrator their is a provision to reset the user credentials.
       
                             Manage Jenkins -> security -> users -> choose user (which need to reset) -> password (give password here)

                        → As a administrator to change the password again you need to inform to the users saying please follow below steps in the password
 
                                   → Once logged into the user Jenkins gui,
 
                                   → click on username(top right corner)
 
                                          eg : Gourishetty harini
 
                                   → click on security then their you can change password and click on save


JENKINS FOLDER:-
     
    In windows os we can see all Jenkins information and configuration details under path C:\programmedata\jenkins\.jenkins

           ->under .Jenkins folder we can see the user folder (where all the Jenkins users data available)

           -> Workspace :- Where all the configured jobs information available 

           ->Secrets :- Where all the configured secrets are available.

           -> Plugins :- All the plugins (which are installed manually and automatically) available
 
           -> Nodes :-  where all the configured nodes are available 

           -> Logs :- we can see slaves (if configured) and tasks, logs are available.
 
          
     A part from the above folders there is Jenkins configurational files namely config.xml (if at all changes the config.xml file, 

     first take the back up of the files (or) copy that config.xml file in some where else. because if we get any issues we can use fresh file again.

         -> We can also use in Jenkins logs in Jenkins GUI, 
                
             Manage Jenkins --> status information --> system log --> all Jenkins logs

   WHERE WE CAN SEE THE JENKINS VERSION?

     We can see the Jenkins version buttom right corner in Jenkins GUI and also 
       
         Manage Jenkins --> status information --> about Jenkins

       * crontab.guru

   WHYS TO TRIGGER THE JENKINS JOB?

         Set up automated actions that start your build based on specific events, like code changes or scheduled times.
 
                   -> Trigger builds remotely (ex: from scripts)

                   -> Build after other projects are built.
                
                   -> Bild periodically 

                   -> GitHub hook trigger for gitscm polling 

                   -> Poll scm

      1. Trigger builds remotely :- 
           
           Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for script)

               -> you'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string so that only those who know it would be able to 
                   remotely trigger this project build's

               ->This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous user

               -> When that's not the case, the case , Jenkins will reject request sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token is specified


                E.g., Use the following URL to trigger build remote

                    JENKINS - URL/Job/ajafreestyle/build?token=TOKEN-NAME of build with parameters? token=TOKEN=NAME 

       2. Build after other projects are built (Upstream & Downstream)

               Setup a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete, for example.

                  -> We need to pass the job name (which are configured already)

                  -> Under "Projects to watch" tab, then we have to pass the job name there.

                  -> There are four options under "Projects to watch":

                         * Trigger only if build is stable (or successful)
 
                         * Trigger even if the build is unstable (or unsuccessful)

                         * Trigger even if the build fails

                         * Always trigger, even if the build is aborted 

        3. Build Periodically: (In schedule)

                  This field follows the syntax of cron . Specifically, Each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or white space:

                      -> Minute  hour  Day of the month  Month  Day of the week.
 
                         *Minute → 0-59
                         
                         *hour → 0-23

                         *DOM → 1-31
      
                         *Month → 1-12
                      
                         *DOW → 0-7 (or 1-7)      0 is sunday (or 1 is monday)

              To specify multiple values for one field, the following operations are available. In the order of precedence


                          * For reference or practice go with the Website crontab.guru

         4. Github hook trigger for GIT SCM polling?

              When Jenkins receives a Github Push hook, GitHub plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a github repository which matches the git repository 
               defined in SCM Git section of the job. 

         5. Poll SCM (Poll Source Code Management)

1) Job configuration of build periodically trigger and poll scm trigger

   create new item(job or project)

   go for triggers tab

   check the box build periodically or poll scm

   once clicked on checkbox schedule comment box will be open there we need to schedule as per requirement

 example: to schedule a job at every minute every hour on Saturday and February

          * * 8 2 6

          where first star means every minute

          where second star means every hour 

          where number 8 is day of the month

          where 2(February) is the month

          where 6(Saturday) is the day of the week

          click on save and check for the jobs

          whether running as per the schedule or not

2) Build after other projects are build:

  create more than one job(s) then in triggers option select build after other projects are build once checked that option need to pass projects to watch    name then click on save and check

 example: job1, job2, job3

          for job2 put the upstream project as job1

          for job3 put the upstream job as job2

   when we build the job1, once job1 completed automatically down stream projects has to be build

   for job2 once select the build after other projects are build and then select sub option trigger even if the build fails then save for job1 do some    mistake wantedly and check for all the jobs

  pipeline project

  we are going for pipeline project in order to secure the CICD pipeline code by storing in any of the repositories(GitHub, bitbucket, gitlab)

  sample helloworld pipeline script creation click on new item select pipeline and click on ok then go for pipeline option in configuration where we can   define or write the pipeline
  script you can write script tab or else we can take it from scm

 In the script tab click on dropdown option to try sample pipeline

pipeline {
   
    agent any
       
         stages {

               stage('Hello') {

                         steps {

                              echo 'Helloworld'
                              }
                      
                            }
                        }
                  } 

 click on save

  make sure that stage view plugin should be installed so that we can see stages

  Rebuild vs Replay

  when we use rebuild we are not changing anything but where as replay gives us provision to change the code then and there. 

  Replay we can also use it as one of the troubleshooting mechanism

  if we do not know how to write pipeline script code we can take the advantage of snippet generator in pipeline syntax option
  (pipeline syntax option will only visible when you create pipeline job or project)
  this snippet generator will help you learn the pipeline script code which can be used to define various steps. pick a step you are interested in from the   list configure it,
  click generate pipeline script and you will see a pipeline script statement that would call the step with that configuration you may copy and paste the   whole statement in to your script or pickup just the options you care about.

 example: to print message
          in sample step of snippet generator we can search for the echo where is a step echo print message then what message you want to print we have to           
           pass if in message block then click on generate pipeline script which will give us script to print message
           by default pipeline execution will work on serial mode (one by one). if the previous stage is passed then only it will go for next or further stages.


                   Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM.
            
             -> Apart from the above 5 ways we can also trigger jobs manually from the Jenkins console, or using a script.



HOW TO CREATE A NEW ITEM PROJECT?

 * click on new item given the job name and select the item scroll down to bottom there you can see copy from option in that copy from tab we need to pass    the job name which we want to need to pass the existing job name which we want to make use of existing job configuration

EXAMPLE:~ create a job 10 .(take the reference of job8 configuration)


 HOW TO CHNAGE THE DEFAULT PORT NUMBERS OF JENKINS?

 * go to the path c:\programfiles\jenkins
 * in that folder find the jankins.xml file 
 * search for "--httpport=8080"in jenkins.xml file where 8080 is the default port number in order to change this default port number
   we should replace 8080 by our own port number then save it once modified this jenkins.xml file restart the jenkins server

 NOTE:~ before changing any jenkins configuration (or) port number better to take backup oforiginal file for safer side


 WHAT IF JENKINS ADMINISTRATOR FORGET FORGET PASSWORD?  
 
 * go to jenkins home directory C:\programData\jenkins\.jenkins in that path open config.xml file search for <use secirity> true</use security> replace true    with false <use security>false<\usesecurity> then save it then browser access the jenkins url where you will not see any login details & user detail in    jenkin GUI

 * go for the manage jenkins "security" undersecurity realm (where we change config.xml file from true to false it will be none) then we need to change    "none" to "jenkins" own user database 

 * authorization (when we chnage config.xml file from true to false authorization will change to any one can do any thing) here we need to change from any    one can do any thing to either martix based or project based strategy

 * once you select martix based or project based strategy under that uncheck the anonymous and click on add user button and add the admin user and give the    role  as administrator

 * then we have to save it;    manage jenkins -->user -->adminuser



 -> change the password then we have to save it.
 
 -> Now we need to restart the Jenkin Server.
 
 -> Notes Better take backup of config.xml file for Safe Side.
 
 -> Before restarting Jenkins
 
 -> once restarted check with admin user whether admin user has all the privileges or not.
 
 -> then go back to config.xml file and modify user security tag from false to true then restart the Jenkin server.

 Using Jenkins Environment Variables
 
 Jenkins pipeline Exposes Environment variables via the global variable Env, which is available from anywhere within a Jenkins file.
 
 -> Below are some environment variables.
 
 BUILD_ID - The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created.
 
 Likewise we have "BUILD_NUMBER", "BUILD_TAG", "BUILD_URL", "JENKINS_URL", "JOB_NAME", "NODE_NAME", "WORKSPACE"
 
 Here's how you can create your Word document:

 Ex: Use the Jenkins file (Declarative pipeline) - https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables
 
 copy this code and create item in Jenkins for pipeline job replace the script with copied code and save it and run (or) build it Expected output should be   "Running 1 on http://localhost:8080/"
 
 Task - Even though we can change the default port number of Jenkins from 8080 to other port but here still showing default port number only figure it out.
 
 How to Parameterized the Jenkins Job?
 
 -> Parameters allow you to prompt users for one or more inputs that will passed into a build.
 
 -> Create New Job in General configuration of that job you can see the option "This project is parameterized" need to check box that and there you will         option add parameter dropdown. Click on that you will see various parameters those are Boolean choice, Credentials, file, multi-line string, password,       Run, string.
 

 -> For example, click on choice parameter (defines a simple string parameter, which can be selected from a list you can use it during a build) give the     name as Env, and choices you can give more than one environment name and under description that will be shown to the user and click on Save.
 
 -> When you check the job to be triggered you will see build with Parameters option click on that and select the choices which we configured and go for the     build button.
 
 -> Another way of Creating Jenkins user?
 
    Manage Jenkins -> security -> directon the disable "keep"
