HOW TO START AND STOP THE APACHE MAVEN TOMCAT:-

  TO START:-
    Apache tomcat --> bin --> startup (windows batch file)
    
  TO STOP:- 
     Apache tomcat --> bin --> shut down (windows batch file)

  For configurational changes:-
      Apache tomcat --> conf

  Foe hosting of the application (Artifacts/deployable package)   
      Apache tomcat --> webapps
   
  FOR LOGS
    Apache tomcat --> logs(Apache tomcat and also applicable which is running inside tomcat)

  WE CAN ACCESS TOMCAT USING LOCAL HOST 8080 or else 127.0.0.1.8080






1) Apache TomCat Folder Structure
 
   conf-configuration
   bin-binary (to start and stop the server)
   webapps-hosting the application
   logs-server logs
   lib-libraries
   temp-temporary files
 
 
2) How to access the application url:
   127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080
<url of TomCat>/<ArtifactName>
 
   Ex:localhost:8080/aja 
   where "aja"-->Artifact Name
 
3) To create project in maven:
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example.helloworld -DartifactId=helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp 
    -DinteractiveMode=false
 
4) How we can place the artifact from the maven project of target folder to apache tomcat webapp folder:
  cp <pathwhereartifact> <path where webapps of tomcat>
  cp <source> <destination>
<destinationfolder> cp/<source> .
 
   while copying use forward slash "/"
 
4) If we do any configuration changes we need to restart the server
   To change the port number of tomcat server we need to stop and start server
   To stop tomcat ctrl+c
 
5) To deploy the application anotherway is by using the tomcat gui
   Access the url of tomcat then search for the .war file to deploy
   click on choose file it will open dialogbox in dialogbox we need to select the artifact and click on open then we need to click on deploy button
 
6) how can we access apache tomcat GUI go to tomcat home folder
   home folder of apache tomcat -->conf
   modify "tomcat-user.xml"(using text editor eg:vi)
   vi tomcat-user.xml (we need to search for the line)<user username="admin"
   need to uncomment these lines -- "<!--" "-->"
   once we modify tomcat-user.xml file save and quit
 
7) what is the difference between pom.xml and settings.xml
   Use pom.xml to define dependencies, plugins, and configurations specific to a project.
   Use settings.xml to configure Maven behavior globally, such as repository authentication and proxy settings.
 
 
8)to view the last n number of lines where n is a number: tail -15 filename
 
9)to view the first n number of lines where n is a number: head -2 filename



                                       *JBOSS WILDFLY*




1) what is Jboss?
   Jboss is a powerful open source java application server developed by Redhat.
 
   website name:wildfly.org/downloads/
   current version is 35
 
   admin port no:9990
 
   application port no or artifacts:8080
 
   Admin: <URL:9990>
   Application:<URL:8080>/<application-name>
 
2) Folder structure of the Jboss wildfly
 
   domain
   modules
   welcome-content
   docs
   bin
   appclient
 
one of the folder in folder structure standalone where we will be having the configuration and deployment folder and logs.
 
configuration:where we will be having configurations of applications, users specifics.
 
ex:mgmt-users.properties and mgmt-groups.properties
 
Logs:standalone -->log -->logs of the wildfly
 
3) To start the Jboss go to the home folder of the wildfly then bin folder
 
   Home folder of wildfly-->bin
   Filename:standalone(windows batch file)
 
4) How to shutdown Jboss wildfly in windows(task)?
   bin-->jboss-cli.bat(click on this file and type command shutdown)
 
5) How to create management console user?
   management console user:
<Home folder of wildfly>-->bin
   filename:add-user(windows batch file)
 
once you run that add-user file we will get this console
what type of user do you wish to add?
a) management user(mgt-user.properties)
b) application user(application-user.properties)
 
a) a
 
It will going to ask me the username after username it will ask you for the password after setting password it will ask you to reenter the password
 
Admin/management console:<URL:9990>
 
username & password
 
     Deployments:
 
* A deployment represents anything that can be deployed(ex: an application such as EJB-JAR,WAR,EAR any kind of standard archive such as RAR or JBOSS-specific deployments)in to a server
  you can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments simply drag one or several files on to the deployment column.
  If there is already a deployment with the same name the deployment will be replaced otherwise the deployment will be added.The deployments added by drag and drop will be enabled by default.
  Left side when you click on plus symbol you will see options like upload deployment, unmanaged deployment,create empty deployment
  clicking on upload deployment
 
6) How to deploy the application or artifacts to the wildfly?
a. copying the war file and pasting it deployment folder of wildfly(Home of wildfly -->standalone -->deployments)
b. cp <artifact sourcepath> <destination of deployments of wildfly>
c. Jboss wildfly GUI-->upload Artifact
 
7) How we can change default port numbers of wildfly (9990 and 8080)task.
   standalone-->configurations-->standalone.xml and standalone-full.xml(change port numbers here)
 
8) How we can configure master/slave architecture in wildfly
Domain Mode:         WildFly must be run in domain mode to enable master/slave functionality. 
Domain Controller:   The master server acts as the domain controller, responsible for distributing configuration and deployments to the slave servers. 
Configuration File:   The domain.xml file defines the domain configuration, including the master and slave servers, and their communication details.
